        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-exclusions/">CSS Exclusions module</a> enables you to customize the areas that text flows inside and around.</p>

        <p>We have put together a set of simple demos for you that show off these capabilities. Be sure to check back here often as we'll be updating them regularly.</p>

        <div class="demos">
            <h2 id="samples_basic">Basic samples</h2>
            <ul class="samples">
                <li>
                    <a href="basic/shape-inside-simple.html" target="blank_">Simple shape insides</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h2>
        <p>Currently CSS Exclusions is not fully implemented in any browsers though we are starting to contribute the early parsing and geometry pieces to WebKit.</p>

        <p>We have made some progress on the shape-inside property, and invite you to take the feature for a test drive.
        To try out exclusions, you will need to use <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs">Google Chrome Canary</a>, and enable the "Experimental WebKit features" flag under <code>chrome://flags</code>.
        After enabling the flag, you will be prompted to restart your browser for the new settings to take effect.
        For more info on enabling experimental features in Chrome, check out <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2012/07/all-about-chrome-flags.html">this article</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="benefits">Why use CSS Exclusions</h2>

        <p>CSS Exclusions provides a great benefit to both web designers as well as developers. The specification outlines a concise syntax for creating non-rectangular areas of text.</p>

        <p>With CSS Exclusions, you can take advantage of new CSS properties that let you build rich interfaces with custom text exclusions. Custom text exclusions allow text
        to be excluded by shapes or images.</p>

        <p>CSS Exclusions is easy to pick up. They build upon familiar CSS properties and structures. Additionally, CSS Exclusions are often used in conjunction with
        <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/cssregions/">CSS Regions</a>, a feature that lets you control how text flows across different regions in a layout.</p>
