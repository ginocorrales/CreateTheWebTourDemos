	<h1>The multi-column model</h1>
	<p>Multi-column elements flow their contents into column boxes. This contrasts with the traditional
	<p>Usually, columns are ordered in a single row, according to the inline direction of the element.
	In the case of paginated media, a new row is created for the new page &ndash; since column
	boxes should not break.</p>
	CSS model where each element has a box in which the contents are laid out.</p>
	<p>While traditionally the children of a multi-column elements where flowed into columns, new
	CSS specs <em>(e.g. CSS regions)</em> enhance the type of content that can be flown into multiple
	columns.</p>
	<p>Currently, individual columns cannot be styled; for instance, the <code>background-color</code>
	cannot be changed for a single column inside a multi-column element.</p>
	
	<h2>How to achieve multi-column?</h2>
	<p>An element becomes multi-column either of the <code>colum-count</code> or <code>column-width</code>
	CSS properties are not <code>auto</code>. Specifying a value for the any of these properties
	turns the element into a multi-column element. Further use of CSS properties can specify how column
	should be spaced, whether or not they should be visually separated, whether the content should be
	balanced between columns and whether or not columns should be automatically generated.</p>
