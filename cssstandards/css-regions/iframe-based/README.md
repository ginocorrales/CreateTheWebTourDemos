iframe-based CSS regions samples
================================

This set of basic samples was used to gauge the level of support for CSS regions in Internet
Explorer 10. As such, they use iframes for named flow content sources and are only prefixed for
Internet Explorer 10. In other browsers, a warning will be displayed and the samples will fail.
