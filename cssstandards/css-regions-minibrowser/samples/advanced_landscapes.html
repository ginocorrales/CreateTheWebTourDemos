		<h1>Arches National Park</h1>
		<p>lies atop an un&shy;der&shy;ground evap&shy;o&shy;rite lay&shy;er or salt bed, which is the main cause of the for&shy;ma&shy;tion of the arch&shy;es, spires, bal&shy;anced rocks, sand&shy;stone fins, and erod&shy;ed mon&shy;o&shy;liths in the area.
		This salt bed is thou&shy;sands of feet thick in plac&shy;es, and was de&shy;pos&shy;it&shy;ed in the Par&shy;a&shy;dox Ba&shy;sin of the Col&shy;o&shy;ra&shy;do Pla&shy;teau some 300 mil&shy;lion years ago when a sea flowed into the re&shy;gion and even&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly evap&shy;o&shy;rat&shy;ed. Over mil&shy;lions of years, the salt bed was cov&shy;ered with de&shy;bris erod&shy;ed from the Un&shy;com&shy;pahgre Up&shy;lift to the north&shy;east.
		Dur&shy;ing the Ear&shy;ly Ju&shy;ras&shy;sic de&shy;sert con&shy;di&shy;tions pre&shy;vailed in the re&shy;gion and the vast Nav&shy;a&shy;jo Sand&shy;stone was de&shy;pos&shy;it&shy;ed. An ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al se&shy;quence of stream laid and wind&shy;blown sed&shy;i&shy;ments, the En&shy;tra&shy;da Sand&shy;stone, was de&shy;pos&shy;it&shy;ed on top of the Nav&shy;a&shy;jo. Over 5000 feet of young&shy;er sed&shy;i&shy;ments were de&shy;pos&shy;it&shy;ed and have been most&shy;ly erod&shy;ed away. Rem&shy;nants of the cov&shy;er ex&shy;ist in the area in&shy;clud&shy;ing ex&shy;po&shy;sures of the Cre&shy;ta&shy;ceous Man&shy;cos Shale. The arch&shy;es of the area are de&shy;vel&shy;oped most&shy;ly with&shy;in the En&shy;tra&shy;da for&shy;ma&shy;tion.		The weight of this cov&shy;er caused the salt bed be&shy;low it to liq&shy;ue&shy;fy and thrust up lay&shy;ers of rock into salt domes. The evap&shy;o&shy;rites of the area formed more un&shy;u&shy;su&shy;al salt an&shy;ti&shy;clines or lin&shy;e&shy;ar re&shy;gions of up&shy;lift. Fault&shy;ing oc&shy;curred and whole sec&shy;tions of rock sub&shy;sid&shy;ed into the ar&shy;e&shy;as be&shy;tween the domes. In some plac&shy;es, they turned al&shy;most on edge. The re&shy;sult of one such 2,500-foot (760 m) dis&shy;place&shy;ment, the Moab Fault, is seen from the vis&shy;i&shy;tor cent&shy;er.
		As this sub&shy;sur&shy;face move&shy;ment of salt shaped the land&shy;scape, ero&shy;sion re&shy;moved the young&shy;er rock lay&shy;ers from the sur&shy;face. Ex&shy;cept for iso&shy;lat&shy;ed rem&shy;nants, the ma&shy;jor for&shy;ma&shy;tions vis&shy;i&shy;ble in the park to&shy;day are the salm&shy;on-color&shy;ed En&shy;tra&shy;da Sand&shy;stone, in which most of the arch&shy;es form, and the buff-color&shy;ed Nav&shy;a&shy;jo Sand&shy;stone. These are vis&shy;i&shy;ble in lay&shy;er cake fash&shy;ion through&shy;out most of the park. Over time, wa&shy;ter seeped into the sur&shy;face cracks, joints, and folds of these lay&shy;ers. Ice formed in the fis&shy;sures, ex&shy;pand&shy;ing and put&shy;ting pres&shy;sure on sur&shy;round&shy;ing rock, break&shy;ing off bits and piec&shy;es. Winds lat&shy;er cleaned out the loose par&shy;ti&shy;cles. A se&shy;ries of free-stand&shy;ing fins re&shy;mained. Wind and wa&shy;ter at&shy;tacked these fins un&shy;til, in some, the ce&shy;ment&shy;ing ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al gave way and chunks of rock tum&shy;bled out. Many dam&shy;aged fins col&shy;lapsed. Oth&shy;ers, with the right de&shy;gree of hard&shy;ness and bal&shy;ance, sur&shy;vived de&shy;spite their miss&shy;ing sec&shy;tions. These be&shy;came the fa&shy;mous arch&shy;es. </p>
